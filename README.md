sorry for making it messy :
-what should be done for showing reviews rn it is showing on all of them in des order of review_id in Reviews.html 
-deleted email in reservation as user should be login in order to make reservation and we'll get it's email from there
-to make adminReviews different we can also add reply for admin only. Users can only view replies (but that's totally optional)
-MENU, REVIEW and RESERVATION is not really visible on these pictures so maybe move them a bit high(maybe change pic for reservation, some might find it a bit inappropriate)
-kindly, put both filters in same row for AdminReviews
